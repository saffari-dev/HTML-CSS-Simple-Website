        <p><b>(this is random text)</b>Welcome to my world. You will be greeted by the unexpected here and your mind
            will be
            challenged and
            expanded in
            ways that you never thought possible. That is if you are able to survive...
            There are only three ways to make this work. The first is to let me take care of everything. The second is
            for
            you to take care of everything. The third is to split everything 50 / 50. I think the last option is the
            most
            preferable, but I'm certain it'll also mean the end of our marriage.Don't be scared. The things out there
            that are unknown aren't scary in themselves. They are just unknown at the moment. Take the time to know them
            before you list them as scary. Then the world will be a much less scary place for you.
            There was no time. He ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work, but it didn't matter.
            He was late and if he didn't make this meeting on time, someone's life may be in danger.
            The red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox. It had been the last to be played with and anticipated it
            would be the next as well. The other toys grumbled beneath. At one time each had held the spot of the red
            ball, but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box.
            Was it enough? That was the question he kept asking himself. Was being satisfied enough? He looked around
            him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal. He knew that
            he was satisfied and he also knew it wasn't going to be enough.
            She asked the question even though she didn't really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win situation
            since she already knew. If he told the truth, she'd get confirmation of her worst fears. If he lied, she'd
            know that he wasn't who she thought he was which would be almost as bad. Yet she asked the question anyway
            and waited for his answer.</p>

        <p>It was going to rain. The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip did. He had
            learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get outside
            and prepare.
            There was nothing else to do. The deed had already been done and there was no going back. It now had been
            become a question of how they were going to be able to get out of this situation and escape.
            According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the Multnomah Chapter of the Daughters of the
            American Revolution on May 12, 1939, “College Hall (is) the oldest building in continuous use for
            Educational purposes west of the Rocky Mountains. Here were educated men and women who have won recognition
            throughout the world in all the learned professions.”
            Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you purchase a child
            the latest smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the latest gaming
            system, you're likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to
            purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts it's important to remember that some come with additional
            costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself.Love isn't always a ray of
            sunshine. That's what the older girls kept telling her when she said she had found the perfect man. She had
            thought this was simply bitter talk on their part since they had been unable to find true love like hers.
            But now she had to face the fact that they may have been right. Love may not always be a ray of sunshine.
            That is unless they were referring to how the sun can burn.
            Things aren't going well at all with mom today. She is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time. I
            sure hope that things get better soon.
            He lifted the bottle to his lips and took a sip of the drink. He had tasted this before, but he couldn't
            quite remember the time and place it had happened. He desperately searched his mind trying to locate and
            remember where he had tasted this when the bicycle ran over his foot."Can I get you anything else?" David
            asked. It was a question he asked a hundred times a day and he always received the same answer. It had
            become such an ingrained part of his daily routine that he had to step back and actively think when he heard
            the little girl's reply. Nobody had before answered the question the way that she did, and David didn't know
            how he should respond.
            They had no proof. He knew that they knew he had done it but they didn't have any proof. It was a huge
            distinction and it was the difference between him keeping his freedom or being locked away for decades. They
            continued to question him, probing him for information that they could use against him or find the proof
            they needed to put him away. He smiled and continued to block their every inquiry by feigning his innocence
            for a crime they all knew he committed.
